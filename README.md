# Linear-Regression-E-commerce-Dataset

description:

This dataset is having data of customers who buys clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
